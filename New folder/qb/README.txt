Before running the QuestionBank application, make sure the TestManager application is running and ready to receive data.
Also, you have to run two QuestionBanks simultaneously, one for Python and another for Java.

#To compile the Java source file and generate the QuestionBank class:

```
make compile
```

#To run the Python QuestionBank application:

```
make run-python
```

#To run the Java QuestionBank application:

```
make run-java
```

#To clean up and remove the compiled class files:

```
make clean
```

Make sure you navigate to the "qb" subdirectory in your terminal before running these commands.
